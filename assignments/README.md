# FAAST Advance Foundations Assignments

## Introduction

We are going to be using this project throughout the course.

This assignment uses life expectancy in Europe grouped by Country (or other, like group of countries), Age, Sex, and Time. But the data format makes it hard to use. We will be building a pipeline do clean the data, while applying the concepts you've learned in the previous modules.

## Installing

Before installing, make sure your `pip` is up to date.

```bash
pip --version
```

Prior to the introduction of `pyproject.toml`-based builds (in PEP 517 and PEP 518), pip had only supported installing packages using setup.py files that were built using `setuptools`. But in version 21.3, pip added support for performing editable installs of packages that use `pyproject.toml`. This means that you can use pip to install packages described in the `pyproject.toml`.

To update pip, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Now you're ready to go!

1. Clone the Faast-Foundations repo and, from it, create a new repo with just the assignments:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:nosportugal/faast-foundations.git
    cp -r faast-foundations/assignments assignments
    cd assignments
    git init
    ```

    You will be later pushing this new repo to your personal GitHub account.

2. Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`. If you are using conda, you can create a virtual environment with `conda create --name foundations pip`.
3. Activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows. Or, if you are on conda, activate the environment with `conda activate foundations`.

Don't install the project yet. We will do that in [setup assignment](./assignment_0/README.md).

## Using this project

Open the `README.md` file inside each assignment and follow the instructions.

> **Note**: Remember that all commands inside the Readme files assume you are in the root of the project.

You can now start working on the [setup assignment](./assignment_0/README.md). Good luck! ðŸš€
